Erin Shepherd did a splendid job on PDCLib after she took over the project
from me in 2012. Locale support, multibyte and wide character support,
thread support, ...

When I got back into the project, and after a couple of "easy" changes
and improvements, I realized that I did not understand the structure of
Erin's PDCLib well enough to continue contributing, without a high chance
of breaking things, or disrupting what Erin had done.

So I returned to where I left off, and -- with the benefit of being able
to look at Erin's implementation -- started to re-trace her steps.

(Re-) implementing the functionality hopefully gives me a better under-
standing of the inner workings.

Whether I will eventually merge this branch back into default, just pick
up again where Erin left off, or Something Else Completely, remains to
be seen.
